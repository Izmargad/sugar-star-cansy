My first ever image captured on SLOOH was of Caldwell 41 (Mel 25). I was figuring out how it all worked and clicked a few buttons, while viewing live footage. Only after a day, looking at images I captured of the Sun, with the Canary 5, did I realise I had snapped Caldwell 41.

I was more impressed with the picture of our Sun. I think my mind melt a little like the wings of Icarus. I flew too close to something so immense. I imagined how explorers of old must've felt. This was different from looking at a PBS documentary or a BBC show. I took this photo, I observed.

I later sent the photo of this massive orange fruit hanging in the sky as a birthday image to a very dear friend in the US. On the same date I captured inadvertently Caldwell 41, and in retrospect, it is so special that it deserves a special mention too.
