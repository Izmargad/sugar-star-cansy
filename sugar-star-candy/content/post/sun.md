> _Bright as the window beyond death,_
>
> _The light in the universe_
>
> _Cleans the eyes to stone._
>
> _They prayed for lives without visions,_
>
> _Free from visions but not blind._
>
> _They could only drone the prayer,_
>
> _They could not set it down._
>
> _And windows persisted,_
>
> _And the eyes turned stone._
>
> _They all had faces like statue Greeks,_
>
> _Marble and calm._
