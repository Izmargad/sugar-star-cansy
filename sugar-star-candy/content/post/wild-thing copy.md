I am the dust on moon that's never blown over

but remains.

I am the powdered wings of the dead moth. 

I am the water in a rock pool, still, with knowing

awaiting the tide to wash over salted strains. 

I am the silence between the strings of harp.

I hold all potential

to the glint of light 

on water,

before it shimmers.

I am the immovable mind that which takes care

and hushes and consoles the noise of trampling thought explosions.

Inside.

I am the mind that sees in a mirror

that which smiles back, with sadness and recognition.

I am.
