_When the Pleiades fall, I wake looking for my goatskin bag to drink. When (the Pleiades) rise, I wake looking for cloth/clothes to wear. -_ A Tuareg Berber proverb

When I was a little girl, my favourite stars were the three clear ones -- the belt of Orion. There were three sisters, up far in the sky. They reminded me of my own three sisters who were older and less interested in their baby sister. Summer evenings in the Southern Hemisphere, crickets and frogs on a warm summer evening. My mom and dad and I would sit, staring up at the heavens, we would switch all the lights off on the porch. We would hear the neighbour's TV, somewhere the theme song of Dallas or Dynasty or the A-Team jingled over and across to us and out toward the stars where the analog broadcast propagating through space, with Miss Elly and Larry Hagman. Where are they now?

It's 2020 and we have our own true villains in the world. JR Ewing meet Donald J. Trump. But this too shall pass. 

The three sisters, as I referred to the belt of Orion is still up there. And the Pleiades, the seven sisters, I could never quite place them and I struggled to count them sometimes. They grew ever fainter as the lights grew brighter in the cities. Tonight I pointed the Canary One - Half Meter telescope to the Pleiades. Conditions were not ideal. It was blurry, there were clouds and dust and moonlight. 

Yet there they are, the closest sisters shining friendly. I have not ever been this close to them. In another 250 million years from now, the Pleiades will disperse due to gravitational interactions with its galactic neighborhood.

Our lives are complex, and short. The stars live simply, and for a little longer.
